# Fridge-Organizer (2025-12-25)
I made a fridge organizer using Python and a txt file.

## What it does
It uses object-oriented programming to create different fridges with different names and items.
I used a txt file to store data to my computer disk when I stopped the algorithm.

## Why i built it
The reason why I built it is because I was sitting in my mom's car one day on my way to taekwondo training. 
When she complained about wishing she could organize the items in her fridge.

## How it works
The class I used is called "Fridge," and it uses four functions:
  1. init that allows the user to contribute different attributes to their fridge.
  2. show_fridge that prints out the content of the item list.
  3. edit_fridge This allows the user to edit the content of the fridge in the program.
     You can either add or subtract an item in the list.
  4. save_fridge basically enables the program to write down the list contents into a txt file to store
     for later use.

There's also the main loop that makes it into a program.

## What I learned
By making this algorithm, I have learned to save data on my computer disk for later use.
I'm also improving on writing object-oriented scripts, which is going to help me later on.

## Future improvements
In the future I'm thinking about adding a function to add a fridge in the algorithm.
Maybe connecting it to a GUI module like tkinter to make it more user-friendly.
